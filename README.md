# Computing-Inertial-Types-Over-Qp-2
This repository contains the supporting MAGMA files for the research article "Computing Inertial types over Qp^2"

Here is an index for the content of each file.

1-PRE-COMPUTED DATA
"CurvesForP=3.magma" Contains all elliptic curves realizing inertial types of curves with potentially good reduction over Q9.
"NonExCurvesForP=2" Contains all elliptic curves realizing non-exceptional inertial types of curves with potentially good reduction over Q4.
"ExceptionalCurvesForP=2" Contains all elliptic curves realizing exceptional inertial types of elliptic curves over Q4.

2-COMPUTATIONS AND CHECKS
"CheckForP>3" Is a script that verifies for a given field K that the curves given at the end of section 4 realize the types in Corollary 4.2
